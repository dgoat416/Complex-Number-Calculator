# Complex Number Calculator
 Solves complex number arithmetic equations. <br />
 Implemented using my own implementation of a <br />
 stack represented as a doubly linked list.
 
 # Expressions.txt
 An input file containing expressions to evaluate: <br />
33+2i * 4+i= <br />
22+i * 22-i = <br />
(2+3i)/(7+i)%= <br />
(5+3i)/(1+3i)%= <br />
(1+i)%/3+i * 2-i+3= <br />
((1+i)%/3+i * 2-i+3)+(3i+1 * (2i * 2-i%/3))= <br />
9+(1-i) * (1+i)= <br />

# Results.txt
An output file that is the result of the evaluation of each line of expressions.txt: <br />
[130+41i]/1 <br />
[485+0i]/1 <br />
[11+23i]/50 <br />
[2-9i]/-5 <br />
[3-11i]/5 <br />
[61+43i]/-15 <br />
[11+9i]/1 <br />
