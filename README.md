# Complex Number Calculator
 Solves complex number arithmetic equations.
 Implemented using my own implementation of a stack represented as a doubly linked list.
 
 # Expressions.txt
 An input file containing expressions to evaluate:
33+2i*4+i= 
22+i*22-i = 
(2+3i)/(7+i)%=
(5+3i)/(1+3i)%= 
(1+i)%/3+i*2-i+3=
((1+i)%/3+i*2-i+3)+(3i+1*(2i*2-i%/3))=
9+(1-i)*(1+i)=

# Results.txt
An output file that is the result of the evaluation of each line of expressions.txt:
[130+41i]/1
[485+0i]/1
[11+23i]/50
[2-9i]/-5
[3-11i]/5
[61+43i]/-15
[11+9i]/1
